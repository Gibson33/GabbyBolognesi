                I am a graduate from the University of Cape Town with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and
                Economics. My decision to pursue these fields stemmed from a desire to create designs that are not only efficient
                and practical, but also serve the greater good of the community. For this reason, I found my degree highly
                fulfilling and intellectually stimulating.

                I am currently a Data Analyst & Engineer at GUUD, a company focused on mobility to drive solutions for
                the lack of access to affordable and accessible medical care in South Africa.

                In addition, I am studying a part-time Full Stack Web Development course through HyperionDev to continue
                expanding my knowledge in the tech industry and to pursue my interest in the creative and design world.

            <div id="content-file2" class="folder-writeup" style="display: none;">
                I matriculated from Rhenish Girls' High School in 2018 and spent time in Vietnam working as an English
                teacher, gaining both professional and cultural experience through travel. The following year, I began my
                academic journey at the University of Cape Town, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and
                Economics.

                In my current role as a Data Analyst and Engineer at GUUD, I discovered that my passion for learning and
                problem-solving continues to grow. To build on this momentum and deepen my technical and creative skill
                set, I enrolled in the Full Stack Web Development bootcamp at HyperionDev â€” an experience that has been both
                challenging and incredibly rewarding.

                Alongside my technical background, I hold a Trinity College London qualification in Drama and am a
                trained clarinetist through the Royal Schools of Music. The arts have always played an important role in my
                life, and I continue to explore creativity and self-expression through my personal pursuits.
